Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit. Your client is interested in expanding their gaming app to multiple platforms using various software patterns in a distributed environment. Specifically, before making a decision, The Gaming Room has asked for you to evaluate the three traditional operating platforms (Linux, Mac, and Windows), as well as mobile platforms, for how the game application software could be deployed and run and what would be required to do so.The client has requested that you conduct an evaluation of the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each platform and include your findings in the software design template. This will help to inform their decision on the benefits of each platform and their utility in a distributed environment.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel like the wording and terminology are done very well to allow very specific ideas to be understood when reading through it so the point is easly understood.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Due to having a better guide when designing the code it allowed to get thoughts onto paper then allowed the code to be developed easier then it would be just going straight into the code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would review my recommendations due to not being revised a second time I would go back and reread through them and make sure everything is their that needs to be and their is no grammatical errors

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpret the needs like a game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each, theirfor a minimum of four rounds need to be played and their needs to be a one minute timer for each of these four rounds. The user's need are very important most of the time they are helpful guadance towards the finished product because their are a large amount of decisicons that need to be made so its easier if the user helps with those decisions so they are happy with the end product.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I used the Project software design templete to help understand everything that needed to be done for the software to help me hasve a game plan when moving forward in the code development. I will use some form of paper to allow me to get all the requierments and details of the project and then procced from their to develop the code so I have a clear path when designing the code.
